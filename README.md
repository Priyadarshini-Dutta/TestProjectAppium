# TestProjectAppium


My project does various activities with Android Apps .A sample apk file was taken from https://github.com/selendroid/demoproject-selendroid and it was tested using the eclipse, appium ,ui automator.
The language used for developing the script was Java.

The application simple launches the file in the Android emulator and then performs automation of a registration process which includes handling textboxes,checkbox items,buttons,dropdowns,radio buttons.
